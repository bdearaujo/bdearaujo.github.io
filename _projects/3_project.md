We report on the Latency Hammer, a low-cost yet highaccuracy \ and high-precision automated tool that measures \ the interface latency of touchscreen devices. The Hammer \ directly measures latency by triggering a capacitive touch \ event on a device using an electrically actuated touch \ simulator, and a photo sensor to monitor the screen for a \ visual response. This allows us to measure the full end-toend \ latency of a touchscreen system exactly as it would be \ experienced by a user. The Hammer does not require human \ interaction to perform a measurement, enabling the \ acquisition of large datasets. We present the operating \ principles of the Hammer, and discuss its design and \ construction; full design documents are available online. We \ also present a series of tools and equipment that were built to \ assess and validate the performance of the Hammer, and \ demonstrate that it provides reliable latency measurements.{% cite 10.1145/2858036.2858394 %}
